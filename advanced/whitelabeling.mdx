## Whitelabeling Crunchforms
While we don't current offer a fully whitelabeld platform, here are some tips on how to remove Crunchforms branding from email notifications.

### Adding Client Email Addresses
You can add additional email addresses to receive notifications (depending on your plan), as long as they can be verified.

After you add a new email address, they will receive an email with a link to verify the email address can receive notifications from your account.
See our guide on adding additional email addresses in the [Add Email Addresses](/advanced/emails) page.

<Card
    title="Add Email Addresses"
    icon="at"
    horizontal
    href="/advanced/emails"
>
    Add and verify additional email addresses.
</Card>

### Removing Branding from Emails 
By default, email notifications sent from Crunchforms will include some branding in the footer of the email.
To remove this, 
1. Navigate to your [Dashboard](https://crunchforms.com/dashboard) and open the form configuration screen for the form you want to update
2. Turn on the "**Remove Branding from Notifications**" option in your form configuration
3. **Save** your changes
