**Remove Branding from Notifications**: Remove branding and dashboard link from notification email.

**Cloudflare Turnstile Secret Key**: Add your Cloudflare Turnstile secret key to enable advanced bot protection. 

When a value is set in this field, Crunchforms will attempt to validate the submission token found in either the `cf-turnstile-response` or `turnstileToken` fields. If this field is set, submissions without a valid Turnstile token will be rejected.
