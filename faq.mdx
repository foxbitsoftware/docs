    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.

    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`

    Your docs are built using MDX files, which combine Markdown and React components.

    Key files and directories:
    - `docs/`: Contains all your documentation content in MDX format.
    - `docs.json`: Configuration file for your docs site (name, colors, etc).
    - `public/`: Static assets like images used in your docs.

    <Tip>
      Check out our [Essentials](https://crunchforms.com/docs/essentials/markdown) guide to learn how to write and structure your docs.
