## Using Verified Emails for Notifications

After an email address has been verified, it becomes available for use in your form configuration.

1. Open your [**Dashboard**](https://crunchforms.com/dashboard) and select the form you want to update.
2. In the form settings, expand the **Notifications** section.
3. Under **notification Email**, select the verified email address from the dropdown menu.
4. Save your form settings.

The selected email will now receive submission notifications for that form.

<Tip>
    To receive individual notifications for submissions, ensure that the **Email Individual Submission Notifications** option is enabled in the Notifications section.
