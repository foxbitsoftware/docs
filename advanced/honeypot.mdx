## Overview

The Honeypot Field is a simple way to reduce spam without adding friction (such as CAPTCHAs) to your form. When enabled, your form includes a hidden input that human users will leave empty — but bots often complete. Any submission where the honeypot contains a value is treated as spam according to your form’s configuration.

## Enabling the Honeypot Field

You can enable Honeypot protection in the Crunchforms dashboard:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://crunchforms.com/dashboard)
2. Edit the form settings by selecting **Edit Form Settings** from the action dropdown next to the form you would like to edit,
or from the submission view, click the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> button and select **Edit Form Settings**.
3. Click on **Advanced Setttings** to expand the advanced options.
4. Enter the name of the honeypot field you would like to use (e.g., `hp_username`, `website`, etc.) in the **Honeypot Field Name** input. This must match the name attribute of the hidden field in your form. Alternatively, you can click the <Icon icon="arrows-spin" /> button to generate a random field name.

## Adding the Honeypot Field to your Form

If you are building a custom frontend and POSTing to Crunchforms, include a hidden honeypot field in your HTML:

<HoneypotForm />

### Recommended Practices

* **Do not use `display:none`** — bots often ignore fully hidden fields.
* Push the field off-screen using positioning, not `visibility:hidden`.
* Use a natural-sounding field name (e.g., `website`, `username`, `hp_name`).
* Add `tabindex="-1"` to avoid keyboard focus.
* Set `autocomplete` to a non-standard value (e.g., `"nope"`) to prevent browser autofill.

## API Usage

If you are submitting JSON data, include the honeypot field like any other field:

### Example Valid Submission

```json
{
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "{HoneypotFieldName}": ""
}
```

### Example Spam Submission
This submission would be rejected as spam because the honeypot field is filled:

```json
{
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "{HoneypotFieldName}": "Filled by bot"
}
```


## Limitations

* Honeypot fields work best against low-complexity bots.
* Advanced bots may detect hidden fields. For stronger protection, consider other methods like [Cloudflare Turnstile](/advanced/turnstile) or **reCAPTCHA** (coming Soon).
